# Game Systems
* 3 Weapon types
  * Guns need projectiles to shoot
  * Guns need to be able to shoot
  * Guns also need unique spray patterns to make them interesting
  * Weapons are dropped by enemies and can be picked up by the player
  * infinite ammo and no reload to keep it simple
* 3 Enemy types
  * An enemy that moves towards the player
  * An enemy that shoots at the player
  * and an enemy that follows the player and has lots of health
* Enemy spawner
  * There needs to be a system that spawns our enemies
  * It nees to increase spawn rate as time goes on
  * It needs to be able to control how many special enemies spawn
  * Maybe have special patterns that can spawn like only ranged enemies or only a few tanky enemies
* Wave counter
  * I would like the game to run of a wave system
  * When you defeat a wave of enemies the next wave spawns
  * the number of enemies that spawn per wave would increase with the wave count
* Pick ups
  * Increase rate of fire power up
  * Bomb pick up
  * Invincibility power up
  * Health pick up
  * 3 weapon pick ups
