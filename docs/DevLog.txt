# DEPENDENCIES AND STATE
- I manage dependencies right now by instatiating things in a particular order. It would probably be better to have objects instatiate the objects that are dependent on them.
- My game doesn't really use state besides enabled and disabled but I am starting to notice that I should implement it soon especially for my enemies.
# SYSTEMS
- My main systems and patterns are Object Pool and Strategy 
# GAME STRUCTURE

# TECHNICAL DEBT
- The pickup system needs to be refactored and handle better like I did for the enemies.
- I never did figure out a way to instatiate a pool using c# generics but i feel like that would be the ideal instead of what i have now.
- the HUD is hot mess that was quickly throw together. the HUD manager is way wordier than i think it needs to be.
- I should refactor my code to not be dependent on monogame right off of the bat
