# DEPENDENCIES AND STATE
- I manage dependencies right now by instatiating things in a particular order. It would probably be better to have objects instatiate the objects that are dependent on them.
- My game doesn't really use state besides enabled and disabled but I am starting to notice that I should implement it soon especially for my enemies.
# SYSTEMS
- My main systems and patterns are Object Pool and Strategy 
# GAME STRUCTURE

# WHAT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED
- Enemies should be spawned all around the screen instead of just above and ideally in patterns.
- Some of my classes are very bloated and should be split into different parent classes.
- Needs to run off of game state.
- I would like screen shake 
- Game balance also could use work
- The lack of a UI needs to be changed
