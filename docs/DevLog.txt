# DEPENDENCIES AND STATE
- I manage dependencies right now by instatiating things in a particular order. It would probably be better to have objects instatiate the objects that are dependent on them.
- My game doesn't really use state besides enabled and disabled but I am starting to notice that I should implement it soon especially for my enemies.
# SYSTEMS
- My main systems and patterns are Object Pool and Strategy 
# GAME STRUCTURE

# WHAT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED
- The pool class needs to be able to instantiate the queue it uses as a pool. Right now you need to pass the queue into the pool class as you create a new instance.
- There is a very major glitch right now. If one of the managers spawns an object from its designated pool after it became disabled on screen, there is 1 frame where it doesn't update its location. This means theres 1 frame where the enemy or bullet could potentially collide with something before it updates its position.
