# LIMITATIONS
- The game is limited to one player at a time becuase the enemy manager takes in a player reference so the enemies can move towards the player location.
- The player is limited to one gun at a time.
- The number of bullets that are able to be active at one time are limited to the size of the pool they come from.
- The number of spawnable enemies is limited to the size of my enemy pools. this means I could potentially run out of enemies that i could spawn.
- currently enemies can only be normal ranged or tank. If i used decorator pattern to modify my base enemies I could have a ranged tank.

# PATTERNS
- The use of the object pool pattern has led to the entire project leaning on the pool manager. Bullets, Enemies, and pickups etc.
- Strategy pattern has made it very easy to switch between guns and program new ones.
# DEPENDENCIES
- Ranged weapons are dependent on the pool manager to hold its pool.
- The Enemy manager is dependent on the pool manager to hold its pool.
- The Pickup manager is dependent on the pool manager to hold its pool.
- The Enemy manager is dependdent on the player so it can tell the enemies where to go.
