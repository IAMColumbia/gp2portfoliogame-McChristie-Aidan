Release Notes version 1 POC

Both the object pool and strategy pattern are working. 
I have the enemy spawer, enemy pool, player guns, bullet pool, and player working
I'm very close to having a flexible framework I can build upon for the next assaignments

Somethings not in working order:
- the gun targeting logic should work off of the rotation of the player rather than the mouse target
- I need to make and object pool manager or dictionary to store and watch over my pools.
- Enemies need to die after they are hit by a bullet or run into the player
- enemies need to be able to target and move toward the player
-
